# Cypress Workshop

## Quick start

* Clone the repo
* Recommended: `Node.js v18.x`
* **Install**: `yarn`
* **Start**: `yarn start-dashboard`
* **Open browser**:  http://localhost:4200/

## Node Version

Ensure that you're running at least Node 18 - this is a requirement for the project to run.

If currently running an earlier version it is advised to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage the Node versions in your machine.
